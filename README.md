# Rebus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmankiewicz/Rebus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmankiewicz/Rebus)

Rebus is targeted to become a slim C++ JSON ORM and RPC framework.

As it is in an very early stage of development main focus is in developing and testing the json to c++ mapping. When this functionality is robust, work in the database-drivers will begin. And afterwards implementation of RPC-functionality is planned.
