# Rebus

Rebus is targeted to become a slim C++ JSON ORM and RPC framework.

As it is in an very early stage of development main focus is in developing and testing the json to c++ mapping. When this functionality is robust, work in the database-drivers will begin. And afterwards implementation of RPC-functionality is planned.
